# TixTaxToo
To Draw Board:
(All you need to set : SCREEN_H / W / ROWS_TOTAL / LINE_W) - The program takes care of the rest

v0.9.1 - 4/14/2015 - 17:06 EST;
Updated the HandleEvent to allow a sort of "click and drag" effect

v0.9 - Update: 4/14/2015 - 05:15 EST;
Updated the HandleEvent function && Created algorithm to draw board && Updated tTile class

IF: There are an even amount of boxes - The game will NOT reset once all boxes are filled (Try filling all the boxes with ROWS_TOTAL = 3) - Now try ROWS_TOTAL = 4

v0.7 - Update: 4/13/2015 - 20:45 EST;
Added the HandleEvent Function for tTile - We can now read mouse input!

v0.5 - Update: 4/10/2015 - 01:18 EST;
Got alot done today: Created tTexture Class & started tTile Class - My next update will complete the Handle event that will respond to mouse activity

v0.1 - Update: Finally wrote enough content to post: A little Analysis can go a long way
Overview:
  Tiny Program that simply creates a window, creates a renderer, and uses that renderer to draw two lines to the screen
  The user can either click the red X, or press ESC to exit the program
  
  -Tested and working
