First Group Game! Woohoo!

-Update: Finally wrote enough content to post: A little Analysis can go a long way
Overview:
  Tiny Program that simply creates a window, creates a renderer, and uses that renderer to draw two lines to the screen
  The user can either click the red X, or press ESC to exit the program
  -Tested and working
