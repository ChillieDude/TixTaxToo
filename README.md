Added the HandleEvent Function for tTile - We can now read mouse input!

v0.5 - Update: 4/10/2015 - 01:18 EST;
Got alot done today: Created tTexture Class & started tTile Class - My next update will complete the Handle event that will respond to mouse activity

v0.1 - Update: Finally wrote enough content to post: A little Analysis can go a long way
Overview:
  Tiny Program that simply creates a window, creates a renderer, and uses that renderer to draw two lines to the screen
  The user can either click the red X, or press ESC to exit the program
  
  -Tested and working
